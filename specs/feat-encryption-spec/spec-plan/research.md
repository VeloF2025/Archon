# Encryption Service Research

## Existing Implementation Analysis
The encryption service is already implemented in `python/src/agents/security/encryption_service.py` with the following features:

### Current Features:
- **Encryption Algorithms**: AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA-OAEP
- **Key Management**: Hierarchical key derivation with PBKDF2
- **Data Protection**: Secure data storage and transmission
- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 ready

### Architecture:
- Service-based design with dependency injection
- Support for multiple encryption algorithms
- Key rotation and management capabilities
- Integration with existing security framework

### Testing Status:
- Unit tests implemented
- Performance benchmarks completed
- Security validation passed

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The encryption service is fully implemented and integrated into the Archon security framework. All requirements have been met:

- Enterprise-grade encryption algorithms
- Secure key management
- Compliance with security standards
- Performance optimization
- Integration with existing systems
