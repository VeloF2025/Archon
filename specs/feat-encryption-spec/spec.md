# Enhanced Feature Specification: encryption

**Feature Branch**: `feat-encryption`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement enterprise-grade encryption service for sensitive data protection"

## Execution Flow (Archon + Spec Kit Enhanced)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Generate Test Specifications from Requirements
   → Map each requirement to testable acceptance criteria
   → Validate against Archon's doc_driven_validator.py
7. Run Archon Constitution Check
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
8. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
9. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
10. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for Archon planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- 🧪 Include testable acceptance criteria for each requirement

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation with Archon Integration
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist
4. **Integrate with Archon's doc_driven_validator.py**: Structure requirements to be parsable by the existing system
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

### Archon Test Specifications *(Enhanced Section)*
*These will be parsed by doc_driven_validator.py for automated test validation*

**Test-Driven Development Requirements**:
- [ ] Test scenarios cover all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tests must fail before implementation (TDD Red-Green-Refactor)
- [ ] Tests validate real functionality (no mocks for core features)
- [ ] Tests align with Archon's DGTS anti-gaming system
- [ ] Coverage requirements: >95% meaningful test coverage

**Test Categories**:
- **Happy Path**: [Describe ideal user flow tests]
- **Edge Cases**: [Describe boundary condition tests]
- **Error Handling**: [Describe error scenario tests]
- **Integration**: [Describe integration point tests]
- **Performance**: [Describe performance requirement tests]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Archon Integration Requirements *(Enhanced Section)*
*Requirements that integrate with Archon's existing systems*

**Documentation-Driven Development**:
- **ADR-001**: Feature MUST be documented in PRD/PRP format before implementation
- **ADR-002**: All requirements MUST have corresponding test specifications
- **ADR-003**: Tests MUST be created from documentation BEFORE any code implementation

**Quality Gates**:
- **QG-001**: Feature MUST pass all Archon validation rules
- **QG-002**: Code MUST have zero TypeScript/ESLint errors
- **QG-003**: Implementation MUST NOT include console.log statements
- **QG-004**: Feature MUST achieve >95% test coverage
- **QG-005**: All tests MUST validate real functionality (DGTS compliance)

**Multi-Agent Support**:
- **AS-001**: Feature MUST be implementable by Archon's specialized agents
- **AS-002**: Implementation MUST support parallel agent execution where possible
- **AS-003**: Feature MUST be compatible with ForgeFlow orchestration patterns

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Technical Context *(Enhanced Section - for Planning Phase)*
**Note**: This section is filled during the planning phase, not during spec creation

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
