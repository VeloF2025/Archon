## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Dependency Hell** → Use fixed versions, test thoroughly
2. **Performance Issues** → Add caching, optimize queries
3. **Hallucinations** → 75% confidence rule enforced
4. **Crashes** → Comprehensive error handling

### Process Risks
1. **Scope Creep** → Stick to phase goals
2. **Over-Engineering** → Build only what's needed
3. **Under-Testing** → Automated test suite
4. **Poor UX** → User feedback loops

---

## Success Indicators

### Phase 0-1: Foundation
- System runs for 24 hours without crash
- Can process 100 requests without error
- Response time consistently <2 seconds

### Phase 2-3: Productivity
- Users save 2+ hours per day
- Code quality improves measurably
- Team collaboration increases

### Phase 4-5: Innovation
- Handles complex tasks autonomously
- Generates novel solutions
- Self-improves over time
