-- FIX SECURITY DEFINER VIEW ERRORS
-- =====================================================
-- Fixes 2 SECURITY DEFINER VIEW errors by recreating views
-- without SECURITY DEFINER property to respect RLS policies
-- =====================================================

-- Fix 1: Recreate security_status_prod view without SECURITY DEFINER
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS security_status_prod;

CREATE VIEW security_status_prod AS
SELECT 
    'archon_supabase' as environment,
    current_database() as database_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_proc p
     JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
     WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
     AND p.proname IN ('match_archon_crawled_pages', 'archive_task', 'update_updated_at_column', 'match_archon_code_examples')
     AND p.proconfig IS NOT NULL) as secured_functions,

              JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid  
              WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
              AND p.proname IN ('match_archon_crawled_pages', 'archive_task', 'update_updated_at_column', 'match_archon_code_examples')
              AND p.proconfig IS NOT NULL) = 4 
        THEN '✅ SECURE'
        ELSE '❌ VULNERABLE'
    END as security_status,
    NOW() as deployment_time,
    'supabase_compatible_v1' as version;

-- Fix 2: Recreate archon_rls_performance_status view without SECURITY DEFINER
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS archon_rls_performance_status;

CREATE VIEW archon_rls_performance_status AS
SELECT 
    'RLS_OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETE' as status,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
        AND tablename LIKE 'archon_%'
        AND policyname LIKE '%optimized%'
    ) as optimized_policies,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
        AND tablename LIKE 'archon_%'
    ) as total_policies,
    NOW() as optimized_at;

-- Restore proper permissions (without SECURITY DEFINER)
GRANT SELECT ON security_status_prod TO authenticated, service_role, anon;
GRANT SELECT ON archon_rls_performance_status TO authenticated, service_role, anon;

-- Verification tests
SELECT 'SECURITY DEFINER VIEW FIX VERIFICATION' as status;
SELECT * FROM security_status_prod LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM archon_rls_performance_status LIMIT 1;
SELECT check_rls_optimization_status();

-- Final status
SELECT 
    '✅ SECURITY DEFINER VIEW ERRORS FIXED' as status,
    'Both views recreated without SECURITY DEFINER property' as fix_applied,
    'Views now respect RLS policies properly' as security_improvement;
