# Phase 7: DeepConf Integration Test Suite

This comprehensive test suite validates the Phase 7 DeepConf Integration system following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. All tests are created BEFORE implementation begins (Red Phase of TDD) based on the PRD requirements.

## 🔴 TDD Red Phase Compliance

**IMPORTANT**: All tests in this suite follow TDD Red Phase principles:
- ✅ Tests are created BEFORE implementation begins
- ✅ Tests WILL FAIL until components are implemented
- ✅ Tests validate PRD requirements and specifications
- ✅ Implementation must satisfy test requirements to pass

## 📋 Test Coverage Overview

## 📊 Expected Test Results (TDD Red Phase)

### Current State: 🔴 RED PHASE

**All tests will FAIL until implementation is complete. This is expected and correct behavior for TDD Red Phase.**

### Expected Failures:

```
FAILED test_deepconf_engine.py::test_calculate_confidence_multi_dimensional
FAILED test_multi_model_consensus.py::test_request_consensus_basic_voting  
FAILED test_intelligent_router.py::test_route_task_basic_functionality
FAILED test_scwt_metrics_dashboard.py::test_dashboard_initialization_and_loading
FAILED test_dgts_confidence_integration.py::test_confidence_gaming_detection_integration
...
```

### Failure Reasons:
- `ModuleNotFoundError`: DeepConf modules don't exist yet
- `ImportError`: Components not implemented
- `AttributeError`: Methods not implemented

### Transition to Green Phase:
1. Implement `archon.deepconf.engine.DeepConfEngine`
2. Implement `archon.deepconf.consensus.MultiModelConsensus`
3. Implement `archon.deepconf.routing.IntelligentRouter`
4. Implement `archon.deepconf.dashboard.SCWTMetricsDashboard`
5. Implement integration systems
6. Tests should progressively pass as components are implemented

## 🔍 Debugging Test Failures

### Common TDD Red Phase Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Expected - modules don't exist yet
2. **Attribute Errors**: Expected - methods not implemented
3. **Mock Configuration**: Review `conftest.py` fixtures

### Test Development Guidelines

1. **Write Tests First**: Follow TDD Red Phase strictly
2. **Test PRD Requirements**: Each test should map to specific PRD requirements
3. **Include Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Performance Validation**: Include timing and memory validation
5. **DGTS Compliance**: Prevent gaming and ensure authenticity

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Run specific failing test with verbose output
pytest tests/phase7_deepconf/unit/confidence/test_deepconf_engine.py::test_calculate_confidence_multi_dimensional -v -s

# Run with debugging breakpoints
pytest tests/phase7_deepconf/ --pdb

# Run with coverage to identify missing areas
pytest tests/phase7_deepconf/ --cov=archon.deepconf --cov-report=term-missing
```
