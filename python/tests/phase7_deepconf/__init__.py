"""
Phase 7: DeepConf Integration Test Suite

This test suite validates the Deep Confidence system implementation following TDD principles.
All tests are created from PRD requirements BEFORE implementation begins (Red phase).

Test Categories:
- Unit Tests: Core confidence algorithms and components
- Integration Tests: System integration with Phase 1-9 components
- Performance Tests: Token efficiency, response time, memory usage
- E2E Tests: Dashboard functionality and debugging tools

Coverage Requirements: >95% across all Phase 7 components
DGTS Compliance: Zero confidence gaming or artificial inflation
Performance Targets: 70-85% token savings, <1.5s response time
