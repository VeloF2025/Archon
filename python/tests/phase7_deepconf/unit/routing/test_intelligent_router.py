Unit Tests for Intelligent Task Routing & Model Selection

Tests the intelligent routing system as specified in Phase 7 PRD.
All tests follow TDD Red Phase - they will fail until implementation is complete.

PRD Requirements Tested:
- Task complexity analysis for appropriate model selection
- Cost-performance optimization with token efficiency
- Dynamic load balancing across multiple AI providers
- Performance prediction and resource constraint management
- Token optimization achieving 70-85% savings target

Performance Targets:
- Routing decisions: <500ms for simple tasks
- Token optimization: 70-85% reduction
- Cost optimization without quality degradation
- Performance predictions within Â±10% variance
