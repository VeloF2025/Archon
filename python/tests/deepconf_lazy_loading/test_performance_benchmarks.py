"""
DeepConf Lazy Loading Performance Tests
=====================================

CRITICAL: These tests must FAIL before lazy loading implementation
Tests extracted from PRD Phase7_DeepConf_Integration_PRD.md requirements

Test Philosophy: 
- RED phase of TDD - these tests define the performance requirements
- REAL measurements, not mocked values (DGTS compliance)
- HONEST reporting of current performance issues (NLNH compliance)

PRD Requirements:
- REQ-7.1: Startup time <100ms (current 1,417ms to be removed)
- REQ-7.2: Memory usage <100MB per instance
- REQ-7.3: Response time <1.5s for confidence scoring
- REQ-7.4: Token efficiency 70-85% after optimization
