**REQ-7.6**: Memory efficiency <100MB additional per confidence engine instance
- Source: PRD Section 5.2, Technical Requirements
- Test: Monitor memory usage during lazy initialization

**REQ-7.7**: No degradation of existing Phase 1-6 functionality
- Source: PRD Section 13.1, Integration Points
- Test: Integration tests ensuring backward compatibility

## Test Categories Required

### 1. Performance Tests (Real measurements, not mocks)
- Startup time measurement (target: <100ms)
- Memory usage monitoring (target: <100MB)
- First confidence calculation time (target: <1.5s)
- Token efficiency validation (target: 70-85% savings)

### 2. Integration Tests (On-demand initialization)
- DeepConf components remain uninitialized at startup
- Confidence calculation triggers initialization
- Multi-model consensus lazy loading
- Intelligent routing lazy loading

### 3. Regression Tests (Accuracy preservation)
- Confidence score accuracy comparison
- Uncertainty quantification validation
- Calibration model consistency
- Gaming detection effectiveness

### 4. Edge Case Tests (Error scenarios)
- Initialization failures
- Concurrent initialization requests
- Partial initialization states
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

## Anti-Gaming Requirements (DGTS/NLNH Compliance)

**DGTS-7.1**: Tests must validate REAL lazy loading, not simulated delays
**DGTS-7.2**: Performance measurements must use ACTUAL startup times
**DGTS-7.3**: No fake confidence scores or always-passing assertions
**DGTS-7.4**: Memory tests must measure REAL memory allocation
**NLNH-7.1**: Honest reporting of lazy loading effectiveness
**NLNH-7.2**: Transparent uncertainty about optimization success
