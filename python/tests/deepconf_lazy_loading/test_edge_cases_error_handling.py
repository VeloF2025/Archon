"""
DeepConf Lazy Loading Edge Cases and Error Handling Tests
========================================================

CRITICAL: These tests validate error scenarios and edge cases for lazy loading
Edge case tests for lazy loading error scenarios and startup failures

Test Philosophy:
- RED phase validation - tests define error handling requirements
- REAL error simulation, not mocked exceptions (DGTS compliance)
- HONEST error reporting and recovery behavior (NLNH compliance)

PRD Requirements:
- REQ-7.11: Graceful handling of lazy loading failures
- REQ-7.12: Proper error recovery mechanisms
- REQ-7.13: Resource exhaustion scenarios handled safely
- REQ-7.14: Concurrent initialization error handling
