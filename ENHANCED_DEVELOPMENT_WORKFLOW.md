# Enhanced Development Workflow with Spec Kit Integration

## üöÄ Overview

Archon now includes a fully integrated Spec Kit enhanced development workflow that ensures all new development, enhancements, additions, and changes follow structured specification-driven processes. This integration combines GitHub's Spec Kit methodology with Archon's existing agent system and quality gates.

## üéØ Mandate: Enhanced Process for All Development

**Effective immediately, ALL development activities must use the enhanced Spec Kit process:**

- ‚úÖ **New Features**: Must create enhanced specification before implementation
- ‚úÖ **Enhancements**: Must create enhancement specification before changes
- ‚úÖ **Bug Fixes**: Must create bug fix specification before implementation
- ‚úÖ **Additions**: Must follow specification-driven development process
- ‚úÖ **Changes**: Must validate against existing specifications

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Tools and Commands

### Primary CLI: Enhanced Spec Kit
```bash
# Main CLI - Unicode safe version
python archon-spec-simple.py

# Available commands:
python archon-spec-simple.py --help                    # Show all commands
python archon-spec-simple.py init <project>           # Initialize new project
python archon-spec-simple.py specify <feature> --input "description"
python archon-spec-simple.py plan <spec-file>         # Generate implementation plan
python archon-spec-simple.py tasks <plan-dir>         # Create task list with agents
python archon-spec-simple.py validate <path>           # Validate compliance
python archon-spec-simple.py status                   # Show project metrics
```

### Development Workflow Manager
```bash
# Enhanced development workflow management
python scripts/enhanced-development-workflow.py --setup                    # Setup workflow
python scripts/enhanced-development-workflow.py --new-feature <name> <desc>  # Start new feature
python scripts/enhanced-development-workflow.py --enhancement <name> <desc>   # Start enhancement
python scripts/enhanced-development-workflow.py --bug-fix <description>      # Handle bug fix
python scripts/enhanced-development-workflow.py --validate <feature>        # Pre-development check
python scripts/enhanced-development-workflow.py --compliance               # Check compliance
python scripts/enhanced-development-workflow.py --enforce                  # Enforce workflow
```

### Agent Integration
```bash
# Enhance agents with Spec Kit methodologies
python scripts/agent-enhancement-integration.py --enhance-all    # Enhance all agents
python scripts/agent-enhancement-integration.py --status        # Check enhancement status
python scripts/agent-enhancement-integration.py --setup-integration  # Setup integration scripts
```

## üîÑ Complete Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Specification Creation (Mandatory)
```bash
# For any new development:
python archon-spec-simple.py specify feature-name --input "User description of what needs to be built"

# This creates:
# - specs/feat-feature-name-spec/spec.md (enhanced specification)
# - Includes Archon integration requirements
# - DGTS compliance and quality gates
# - Test specifications and acceptance criteria
```

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
```bash
# Generate four-phase implementation plan:
python archon-spec-simple.py plan specs/feat-feature-name-spec/spec.md

# This creates:
# - spec-plan/plan.md (four-phase implementation plan)
# - spec-plan/research.md (research template)
# - Agent task assignments and quality gates
```

### Phase 3: Task Generation
```bash
# Create comprehensive task list:
python archon-spec-simple.py tasks spec-plan

# This creates:
# - tasks.md (20+ tasks with agent assignments)
# - Strategic planner, system architect, code implementer assignments
# - Test coverage validator and quality reviewer assignments
```

### Phase 4: Validation & Development
```bash
# Validate before development:
python archon-spec-simple.py validate specs/feat-feature-name-spec/

# Only AFTER validation passes, proceed with implementation
# Use ForgeFlow or existing agent workflows
@FF execute tasks.md
```

## ü§ñ Agent Integration & Enhancement

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities
All specialized agents now include Spec Kit enhanced capabilities:

- **Spec Kit enhanced specification parsing**
- **Four-phase planning methodology**
- **User scenario extraction**
- **Acceptance criteria generation**
- **Enhanced specification compliance**
- **TDD documentation validation**
- **DGTS anti-gaming compliance**

### Agent Quality Gates
Enhanced quality gates for all agents:
- **Enhanced specification compliance**
- **TDD documentation validation**
- **DGTS anti-gaming compliance**
- **Pre-implementation validation**

## üîí Pre-commit Validation

### Automatic Validation
The enhanced pre-commit hook automatically validates:
- ‚úÖ Specification exists for all feature development
- ‚úÖ Implementation plan is complete
- ‚úÖ Task list generated with agent assignments
- ‚úÖ Quality gates and compliance checks

### Validation Failure
If validation fails, the commit is **BLOCKED** with guidance:
```bash
üö´ ENHANCED SPECIFICATION VALIDATION FAILED

All development must follow the enhanced Spec Kit process:
1. Create specification: python archon-spec-simple.py specify <feature> --input 'description'
2. Generate plan: python archon-spec-simple.py plan <spec-file>
3. Create tasks: python archon-spec-simple.py tasks <plan-dir>
```
