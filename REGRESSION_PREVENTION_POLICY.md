# 🛑 REGRESSION PREVENTION POLICY

## CRITICAL RULE: NO REGRESSIONS ALLOWED

**MANDATORY**: A new phase MUST improve or equal ALL previous phases' scores. If any regression is detected, the new phase is BLOCKED from deployment until fixed.

## The Policy

### 1. Hard Requirements

Every new phase implementation MUST:
- ✅ **Maintain or improve** all previous phase pass rates
- ✅ **Not degrade performance** by more than 10% for any phase
- ✅ **Pass all existing tests** from previous phases
- ✅ **Not break any existing functionality**

### 2. Regression Blocking

The following regressions will **BLOCK DEPLOYMENT**:

#### Pass Rate Regressions (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- **ANY** decrease in pass rate for previous phases
- Example: Phase 2 was 90%, now 89% = **BLOCKED**

#### Performance Regressions (LIMITED TOLERANCE)
- Performance degradation >1000ms (1 second) = **BLOCKED**
- Performance degradation 500-1000ms = **WARNING** (fix recommended)
- Performance degradation <500ms = **ACCEPTABLE** (monitor)

#### Threshold Violations
- Any phase dropping below 70% pass rate = **BLOCKED**
- Overall pass rate dropping below 80% = **BLOCKED**

### 3. Testing Protocol

Before deploying any new phase:

```bash
# 1. Run comprehensive benchmark
python python/tests/test_comprehensive_scwt_benchmark.py

# 2. Check regression status
# Look for: "REGRESSION CHECK: PASSED" or "DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"

# 3. If blocked, fix ALL regressions before proceeding
```

### 4. Regression Detection

The benchmark automatically:
1. **Saves baseline** after each successful run
2. **Compares** new results with baseline
3. **Identifies** improvements and regressions
4. **BLOCKS** deployment if regressions found

### 5. Example Output

#### ✅ GOOD - No Regressions
```
REGRESSION CHECK: PASSED - No regressions from previous phases

PHASE COMPARISON:
Phase 1: 85% → 87% (+2%)  ✅
Phase 2: 90% → 90% (0%)    ✅
Phase 3: 75% → 78% (+3%)   ✅
Phase 4: 88% → 89% (+1%)   ✅
Phase 5: NEW 92%           ✅

🚀 DEPLOYMENT: ALLOWED
```

#### ❌ BAD - Regressions Detected
```
🚨🚨🚨 DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - REGRESSIONS DETECTED 🚨🚨🚨

BLOCKING REGRESSIONS (MUST BE FIXED):
❌ Phase 2 dropped by 5.0%
❌ Phase 3 below minimum threshold (65.0% < 70%)

PHASE COMPARISON:
Phase 1: 85% → 87% (+2%)  ✅
Phase 2: 90% → 85% (-5%)  ❌ REGRESSION
Phase 3: 75% → 65% (-10%) ❌ REGRESSION
Phase 4: 88% → 89% (+1%)  ✅
Phase 5: NEW 92%          ✅

🛑 DEPLOYMENT: BLOCKED - Fix regressions first
```

## Why This Matters

### The Problem
Without regression prevention:
- Phase 5 (Validation) might break Phase 2 (Multi-Agent)
- Performance improvements might degrade over time
- Early phase functionality gets forgotten and breaks
- Technical debt accumulates invisibly

### The Solution
With regression prevention:
- **Every phase builds on solid foundation**
- **No functionality is lost**
- **Performance stays consistent or improves**
- **Quality ratchets up, never down**

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing a new phase:

- [ ] Write tests for new functionality
- [ ] Run comprehensive benchmark
- [ ] Check for regressions
- [ ] Fix any regressions found
- [ ] Re-run benchmark to confirm fixes
- [ ] Document any improvements
- [ ] Update baseline only after passing

## Regression Fix Priority

If regressions are detected:

1. **CRITICAL** (Fix immediately):
   - Pass rate regressions
   - Phases below 70% threshold
   - Security vulnerabilities introduced

2. **HIGH** (Fix before deployment):
   - Performance >1 second slower
   - Integration failures
   - Memory leaks

3. **MEDIUM** (Fix soon):
   - Performance 500ms-1s slower
   - Minor functionality gaps
   - Documentation out of sync

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced by:

1. **Automated Testing**: `test_comprehensive_scwt_benchmark.py`
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Blocks deployment on regression
3. **Code Review**: Reviewers must check benchmark results
4. **Documentation**: This policy file

## NLNH Compliance

Following NLNH (No Lies, No Hallucination) protocol:
- We report ALL regressions honestly
- We don't hide or minimize issues
- We fix problems before claiming success

## DGTS Compliance

Following DGTS (Don't Game The System) protocol:
- No gaming metrics to pass regression checks
- No disabling tests to avoid failures
- No lowering thresholds to pass

## Summary

**THE GOLDEN RULE**: 
> A new phase that makes previous phases worse is NOT an improvement, it's technical debt.

**THE ENFORCEMENT**:
> Deployment is BLOCKED until all regressions are fixed.

**THE RESULT**:
> Each phase makes Archon better, never worse.
