# ðŸ“Š Archon Priority Update Summary

## What Changed
Reorganized Archon development from complex, overlapping phases to **practical, priority-based tiers**.

## Why It Changed
- Previous phases were too ambitious and interdependent
- Missing dependencies blocking progress
- Need to focus on **getting basics working first**

## New Structure

### Before: Complex Phases
- Phase 7: Autonomous Agents
- Phase 8: Multi-Model Intelligence 
- Phase 9: Autonomous Teams
- Phase 10: Creative AI
- Many overlapping, advanced features

### After: Priority Tiers
- **Tier 1**: Core Stability (Fix crashes, dependencies)
- **Tier 2**: Essential Features (Knowledge, agents)
- **Tier 3**: Enhanced Features (Patterns, collaboration)
- **Tier 4**: Advanced Features (Multi-model, autonomous)
- **Tier 5**: Experimental (Research, innovation)

## Key Documents Created

1. **[ARCHON_PRIORITY_ROADMAP_2025.md](ARCHON_PRIORITY_ROADMAP_2025.md)**
   - Complete priority-based development plan
   - Clear success metrics
   - Weekly implementation strategy

2. **[IMMEDIATE_TASKS.md](IMMEDIATE_TASKS.md)**
   - Daily checklist of critical fixes
   - Quick commands for common operations
   - Current blocker tracking

3. **[PHASES_SIMPLIFIED.md](PHASES_SIMPLIFIED.md)**
   - Streamlined 5-phase approach
   - Focus on practical value
   - Clear definition of done

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- Anti-Hallucination System (75% confidence rule)
- Basic architecture and Docker setup
- Agent definitions
- Documentation structure

### ðŸš§ Immediate Priority
1. Fix dependency issues (prometheus-client, pandas, google-generativeai)
2. Get all services running stable
3. Test core knowledge management
4. Verify agent execution

### ðŸ“‹ This Week's Goal
**Get to "Tier 1 Complete"** - All critical features working reliably

## Next Steps

1. **Today**:
   ```bash
   # Rebuild with updated dependencies
   cd python && docker-compose build archon-server
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Tomorrow**:
   - Test knowledge upload/search
   - Fix any runtime errors
   - Create integration tests

3. **This Week**:
   - Complete Tier 1 (Core Stability)
   - Start Tier 2 (Essential Features)

## Success Metrics

### Tier 1 Success (Core Stability)
- [ ] Runs 24 hours without crash
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] Can process basic requests
- [x] Anti-hallucination working

### Tier 2 Success (Essential Features)
- [ ] Can upload and search documents
- [ ] Agents generate valid code
- [ ] Projects can be managed
- [ ] MCP integration working

## Summary
**From complex overlapping phases to practical priority tiers** - focusing on getting basics working before building advanced features.

The anti-hallucination system with 75% confidence rule is complete. Now focusing on stability and core features.
