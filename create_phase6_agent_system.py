üîß CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PHASE: TRUE SUB-AGENT SYSTEM

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
‚Ä¢ 22 specialized agents exist only as JSON configs - not operational
‚Ä¢ No integration with Claude Code's Task tool system
‚Ä¢ Agents cannot operate independently with their own tools/context
‚Ä¢ Missing Anthropic-style sub-agent architecture
‚Ä¢ No autonomous agent spawning or workflow management

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

**1. Sub-Agent Architecture (Anthropic-Style)**
‚Ä¢ Each agent has isolated tool access and context
‚Ä¢ Agents operate within defined scopes and guardrails
‚Ä¢ Independent workflow execution without Claude Code intervention
‚Ä¢ Agent-to-agent communication protocols
‚Ä¢ Hierarchical agent management (Meta-Agent ‚Üí Sub-Agents)

**2. Claude Code Integration Bridge**
‚Ä¢ Connect 22 specialized agents to Task tool system
‚Ä¢ Auto-spawn agents based on code changes/context
‚Ä¢ Seamless handoff between Claude Code and sub-agents
‚Ä¢ Preserve Claude Code as primary orchestrator
‚Ä¢ Agent results flow back to main conversation

**3. Meta-Agent System**
‚Ä¢ Intelligent agent selection and spawning
‚Ä¢ Cross-agent task coordination
‚Ä¢ Resource management and conflict resolution
‚Ä¢ Agent performance monitoring
‚Ä¢ Dynamic scaling based on workload

**4. Tool & Context Isolation**
‚Ä¢ Each agent gets scoped tool access (file ops, API calls, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Isolated working directories for agent execution
‚Ä¢ Agent-specific knowledge bases and memory
‚Ä¢ Guardrails prevent scope violations
‚Ä¢ Secure inter-agent communication

**5. Autonomous Workflows**
‚Ä¢ File watcher triggers (*.py ‚Üí test_generator, security_auditor)
‚Ä¢ Git hooks integration (pre-commit ‚Üí code_reviewer, quality_assurance)
‚Ä¢ API endpoint changes ‚Üí api_integrator, documentation_writer
‚Ä¢ Database schema changes ‚Üí database_designer, migration_agent
‚Ä¢ UI changes ‚Üí ui_ux_designer, test_generator

**TECHNICAL DELIVERABLES:**
‚Ä¢ Agent Runtime Environment (isolated execution)
‚Ä¢ Task Distribution System (meta-agent orchestration)
‚Ä¢ Tool Access Control Framework
‚Ä¢ Agent Communication Protocol
‚Ä¢ Integration with existing Claude Code workflow
‚Ä¢ Real-time agent monitoring dashboard
‚Ä¢ Agent performance metrics and SCWT benchmarks

**SCWT BENCHMARK TARGETS:**
‚Ä¢ Agent autonomy: ‚â•80% tasks completed without Claude Code intervention
‚Ä¢ Response time: <5s for agent selection and spawning
‚Ä¢ Scope adherence: 100% - no agent scope violations
‚Ä¢ Tool isolation: 100% - proper access control
‚Ä¢ Integration success: ‚â•90% seamless handoffs to/from Claude Code
‚Ä¢ Concurrent agents: Support 8+ simultaneous specialized agents
‚Ä¢ Auto-spawn accuracy: ‚â•85% correct agent selection for triggers

**GATE CRITERIA:**
‚Ä¢ All 22 agents operational and integrated
‚Ä¢ Meta-agent successfully coordinates multi-agent workflows
‚Ä¢ Claude Code maintains primary control while delegating specialized tasks
‚Ä¢ Agent system operates autonomously within defined boundaries
‚Ä¢ Full integration with existing Archon infrastructure (MCP, Memory, Graphiti)

**ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:**
‚Ä¢ Claude Code = Primary Orchestrator (project oversight, complex decisions)
‚Ä¢ Meta-Agent = Sub-Agent Coordinator (task distribution, resource management)
‚Ä¢ Specialized Agents = Scoped Workers (focused expertise, isolated execution)
‚Ä¢ Seamless handoff between layers based on task complexity and scope

This phase is CRITICAL for Archon's evolution from a tool system to a true multi-agent development environment.

üéØ **Status**: Ready for implementation - highest priority
üìÖ **Dependencies**: Phases 1-5 complete, Agent configs and orchestrator code exist
üîß **Complexity**: High - requires deep integration with Claude Code architecture

‚è≥ This task will be executed by the Archon Meta-Agent with Claude Code oversight."""
