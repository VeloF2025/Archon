## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Knowledge Silos**: Each project's learnings aren't automatically shared
2. **Manual Pattern Recognition**: Developers must identify patterns manually
3. **Static Intelligence**: Agents don't learn from their successes/failures
4. **Limited Integration**: Not deeply integrated with development workflows
5. **Reactive Assistance**: System responds to problems rather than preventing them

### Opportunity
Create a proactive, learning system that continuously improves and provides predictive assistance throughout the development lifecycle.
