# Phase 9: Multi-User Team Collaboration - PRD

## Executive Summary

Phase 9 transforms Archon from single-user development assistant into a **distributed team collaboration platform**. This phase introduces Redis-based coordination, multi-user conflict resolution, and shared knowledge base management for development teams.

## Problem Statement

### Current State (Phase 1-8)
- ✅ Single-user Archon instance per developer
- ✅ Local conflict resolution with queue serialization
- ✅ Individual knowledge bases per instance
- ✅ Agent orchestration within single Docker environment

### Team Collaboration Challenges
- **Conflicting Changes**: Multiple developers modifying same files simultaneously
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Separate knowledge bases per developer
- **Resource Duplication**: Each developer runs full Archon stack
- **Context Loss**: No shared understanding of project state across team
- **Coordination Overhead**: Manual synchronization of insights and patterns

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Distributed Conflict Resolution**: Handle file-level conflicts across multiple Archon instances
2. **Shared Knowledge Base**: Centralized knowledge repository accessible by all team members  
3. **Real-time Coordination**: Live updates of agent activities across team
4. **Resource Optimization**: Shared services for expensive operations (embeddings, crawling)
5. **Team Dashboard**: Unified view of all team member activities and insights

### Performance Requirements
- **Latency**: <100ms for conflict resolution decisions
- **Throughput**: Support 10+ concurrent developers
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for coordination services
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for Redis cluster

## Architecture Overview

### Distribution Model: Hub-and-Spoke
```
Central Archon Hub                    Developer Instances
┌─────────────────┐                  ┌─────────────────┐
│ Redis Cluster   │◄────────────────►│ Archon Local #1 │
│ Shared KB       │                  │ (Developer A)   │
│ Coordination    │◄────────────────►│ Archon Local #2 │
│ Team Dashboard  │                  │ (Developer B)   │
└─────────────────┘                  └─────────────────┘
```

### Redis Architecture
```yaml
Redis Services:
  coordination:
    purpose: Distributed locks, task queues, agent coordination
    data_structures: ["distributed_locks", "task_queues", "agent_registry"]
    
  knowledge_sync:
    purpose: Shared knowledge base synchronization
    data_structures: ["kb_updates", "embedding_cache", "crawl_results"]
    
  team_awareness:
    purpose: Real-time team activity and notifications
    data_structures: ["activity_stream", "presence", "notifications"]
```

## Core Features

### 1. Distributed Conflict Resolution
**Current**: Local locks via `ConflictResolutionStrategy.QUEUE_SERIALIZE`
**Phase 3**: Redis-based distributed locks

```python
class TeamConflictResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis_cluster = RedisCluster(nodes=redis_nodes)
        self.strategy = ConflictResolutionStrategy.REDIS_DISTRIBUTED_LOCKS
    
    async def acquire_distributed_lock(self, resource: str, timeout: int = 30):
        # Distributed lock with automatic timeout and deadlock prevention
        lock_key = f"archon:team:lock:{resource}"
        return await self.redis_cluster.set(lock_key, developer_id, nx=True, ex=timeout)
```

### 2. Shared Knowledge Base
**Current**: Individual Supabase instances per developer  
**Phase 3**: Centralized knowledge with Redis caching

```python
class SharedKnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.supabase_shared = create_client(SHARED_KB_URL, SHARED_KB_KEY)
        self.redis_cache = RedisCluster(nodes=redis_nodes)
    
    async def sync_knowledge_updates(self):
        # Real-time sync of crawled sources, embeddings, and insights
        # Cache frequently accessed embeddings in Redis
        # Notify team members of new knowledge additions
```

### 3. Team Coordination Engine
```python
class TeamCoordinationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis_pubsub = RedisCluster(nodes=redis_nodes)
        self.team_registry = TeamMemberRegistry()
    
    async def coordinate_agent_tasks(self, task: AgentTask):
        # Check for conflicting tasks across team members
        # Distribute expensive operations (crawling, embeddings)
        # Share results with team through Redis pub/sub
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 9.1: Redis Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Redis cluster setup with persistence
- [ ] Docker Compose integration for Redis services
- [ ] Connection pooling and failover handling
- [ ] Redis security (auth, TLS, network isolation)

### Phase 9.2: Distributed Locks (Week 3-4)  
- [ ] Replace `QUEUE_SERIALIZE` with `REDIS_DISTRIBUTED_LOCKS`
- [ ] Implement deadlock detection and resolution
- [ ] Add lock monitoring and diagnostics
- [ ] Performance testing with concurrent developers

### Phase 9.3: Shared Knowledge Base (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Centralized Supabase instance for team
- [ ] Redis caching layer for embeddings and search results  
- [ ] Knowledge sync protocols between local and shared KB
- [ ] Conflict resolution for overlapping crawls

### Phase 9.4: Team Dashboard (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Real-time activity feed for team members
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring (who's running what agents)
- [ ] Shared insights and patterns discovery
- [ ] Team notification system

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
```yaml
Redis Cluster:
  nodes: 3 (minimum for high availability)
  memory: 8GB per node
  persistence: RDB + AOF
  security: AUTH + TLS

Shared Services:
  knowledge_base: Centralized Supabase instance  
  embedding_service: Shared GPU resources for team
  crawling_service: Distributed crawling with rate limiting
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Team Coordination
REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES=redis-1:6379,redis-2:6379,redis-3:6379
TEAM_ID=development-team-alpha
DEVELOPER_ID=alice-smith

# Shared Knowledge Base
SHARED_SUPABASE_URL=https://team-kb.supabase.co
SHARED_SUPABASE_KEY=eyJ0eXAi...

# Conflict Resolution  
CONFLICT_STRATEGY=REDIS_DISTRIBUTED_LOCKS
LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

## Migration Strategy

### From Phase 8 → Phase 9
1. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with distributed locks, maintain local KB
2. **Knowledge Migration**: Sync individual KBs to shared instance  
3. **Team Onboarding**: Add developers one-by-one with proper training
4. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to local-only mode if needed

### Developer Experience
```bash
# Current: Individual Archon
docker-compose up  # Local instance only

# Phase 3: Team-connected Archon  
export TEAM_MODE=enabled
export DEVELOPER_ID=alice
docker-compose --profile team up  # Connects to Redis cluster
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Redis Cluster Failure**: Multi-node setup with automatic failover
- **Network Partitions**: Graceful degradation to local-only mode
- **Knowledge Conflicts**: Last-writer-wins with conflict notifications
- **Performance Degradation**: Redis connection pooling and caching strategies

### Team Risks  
- **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive documentation and training materials
- **Coordination Overhead**: Smart defaults to minimize manual coordination
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for shared resources

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **Lock Acquisition Time**: <50ms average
- **Knowledge Sync Latency**: <200ms for updates
- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Concurrent Users**: 10+ developers without performance degradation

### Team Productivity KPIs
- **Conflict Reduction**: 80% fewer file conflicts vs. manual Git coordination
- **Knowledge Reuse**: 60% of searches served from shared cache
- **Duplicate Work Elimination**: 50% reduction in redundant crawling/analysis

## Future Considerations (Phase 4+)
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple teams/organizations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Team productivity insights and patterns
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Webhooks, APIs for external tool integration
- **Enterprise Features**: SSO, audit logs, compliance reporting
