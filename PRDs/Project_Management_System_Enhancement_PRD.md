# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Archon Project Management System Enhancement

**Project**: Archon PM System Auto-Discovery & Intelligence
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: August 31, 2025
**Status**: Strategic Priority - Critical

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The Archon Project Management system severely underrepresents actual development progress, tracking only 8% of completed work (2/25+ major implementations). Critical completed features like MANIFEST integration, Socket.IO fixes, API timeout handling, backend health monitoring, chunks count fixes, and confidence API implementations are completely invisible in the project management dashboard.

### Solution Overview
Implement an intelligent, auto-discovery Project Management system that automatically detects, categorizes, and tracks completed implementations through Git history analysis, agent execution monitoring, and real-time code validation. This system will achieve 95%+ work visibility accuracy while eliminating manual task management overhead.

### Business Impact
- **Visibility**: Increase project completion visibility from 8% to 95%+
- **Planning**: Enable accurate sprint planning and resource allocation
- **Stakeholder Trust**: Provide real-time, accurate project status reporting
- **Agent Productivity**: Automatic work tracking reduces administrative overhead
- **Risk Management**: Early detection of scope creep and technical debt

## 2. Product Vision & Strategic Goals
