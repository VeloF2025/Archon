# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Archon 3.0: Intelligence-Tiered Adaptive Agent Management System

## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Archon 3.0 - Adaptive Agent Orchestration Platform  
**Version:** 3.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Author:** Archon Development Team  
**Status:** Planning Phase

### Vision Statement
Transform Archon from a static agent orchestration tool into a self-organizing, learning ecosystem where Claude-powered agents dynamically spawn, evolve, and share knowledge to deliver optimal solutions while minimizing computational costs.

### Problem Statement
Current agent systems suffer from:
- **Knowledge Loss**: Agents are destroyed after tasks, losing valuable learnings
- **Cost Inefficiency**: All tasks use the same model tier regardless of complexity
- **No Evolution**: Agents don't improve over time or learn from past experiences
- **Static Configuration**: Agents can't adapt to changing project needs
- **Isolation**: Agents work in silos without knowledge sharing

### Solution Overview
Archon 3.0 introduces an intelligence-tiered, self-organizing agent management system that:
- Dynamically spawns project-specific agents based on detected needs
- Routes tasks to appropriate Claude model tiers (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) based on complexity
- Maintains agent lifecycle states (Active/Idle/Hibernated) to preserve knowledge
- Enables real-time knowledge transfer between agents
- Builds project-specific knowledge bases that evolve over time

- **Role**: Senior Full-Stack Developer at Healthcare Startup
- **Needs**: Reliable, compliant code generation with consistent patterns
- **Pain Points**: Repetitive implementation of similar features, maintaining consistency

### 2.2 Key Use Cases

#### **Use Case 1: First Project Activation**
```
GIVEN a developer activates Archon for a new project
WHEN Archon analyzes the codebase
THEN it should:
  1. Detect technology stack and architecture
  2. Identify needed specialized agents
  3. Spawn project-specific agents with appropriate model tiers
  4. Build initial knowledge base from existing code
  5. Report readiness with agent roster
```

#### **Use Case 2: Complex Feature Implementation**
```
GIVEN a developer requests a complex feature (e.g., "Add OAuth with MFA")
WHEN Archon receives the request
THEN it should:
  1. Assess task complexity (score: 0.9 - requires Opus)
  2. Check for idle OAuth-specialist agent or spawn new one
  3. Retrieve relevant patterns from knowledge base
  4. Execute with learning context
  5. Store successful patterns for future use
```

#### **Use Case 3: Routine Maintenance Task**
```
GIVEN a developer needs to remove console.log statements
WHEN Archon receives this simple request
THEN it should:
  1. Assess complexity (score: 0.2 - use Haiku)
  2. Activate or spawn simple-task agent
  3. Execute quickly with minimal cost
  4. Hibernate agent after completion
```

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Agent Lifecycle Management

#### **F-ALM-001: Agent State Machine**
Agents must support the following states:
- **CREATED**: Initial spawn, loading knowledge
- **ACTIVE**: Currently executing tasks
- **IDLE**: Available for immediate task assignment (hot standby)
- **HIBERNATED**: Suspended to save resources, state preserved
- **ARCHIVED**: Deprecated but knowledge extracted and stored

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- State transitions logged with timestamps
- Automatic hibernation after 15 minutes idle
- Wake from hibernation < 100ms
- Knowledge preserved across all state transitions

#### **F-ALM-002: Dynamic Agent Spawning**
System must automatically spawn agents based on project needs:
```python
Required Capabilities:
- Analyze project to identify needed agent types
- Spawn agents with appropriate model tiers
- Inherit knowledge from similar existing agents
- Register in agent pool for reuse
```

#### **F-ALM-003: Agent Pool Management**
Maintain optimal agent pool size:
- Maximum active agents per tier: Opus(2), Sonnet(10), Haiku(50)
- Automatic resource optimization every 5 minutes
- Hibernation of idle agents
- Archival of unused agents after 30 days

### 3.2 Intelligence Tier Routing

#### **F-ITR-001: Task Complexity Assessment**
Automatically evaluate task complexity (0.0-1.0 scale):

| Complexity Score | Model Tier | Use Cases |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| 0.8 - 1.0 | Claude Opus | Architecture design, security analysis, complex debugging |
| 0.4 - 0.79 | Claude Sonnet | Feature implementation, testing, refactoring |
| 0.0 - 0.39 | Claude Haiku | Formatting, simple fixes, documentation |

**Assessment Factors:**
```python
complexity_factors = {
    "requires_architecture_decisions": +0.3,
    "involves_security_compliance": +0.25,
    "cross_system_integration": +0.2,
    "creative_problem_solving": +0.15,
    "simple_text_manipulation": -0.4,
    "formatting_only": -0.5
}
```

#### **F-ITR-002: Cost Optimization Engine**
Track and optimize costs in real-time:
- Cost per task tracking
- Budget alerts and limits
- Automatic tier downgrade for budget constraints
- ROI calculation per agent

### 3.3 Knowledge Management System

#### **F-KMS-001: Knowledge Storage Architecture**
Multi-layer knowledge storage:
```
/archon/knowledge-base/{project-id}/
├── patterns/           # Discovered code patterns
├── decisions/          # Architectural decisions
├── failures/           # What didn't work (anti-patterns)
├── optimizations/      # Performance improvements
├── relationships/      # Component interactions
└── agent-memory/       # Individual agent memories
```

#### **F-KMS-002: Knowledge Transfer Protocol**
Enable knowledge sharing between agents:
- **Synchronous Transfer**: Direct agent-to-agent for critical knowledge
- **Asynchronous Broadcast**: Publish discoveries to relevant agents
- **Inheritance**: New agents inherit from parent agents
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Share general patterns across projects

#### **F-KMS-003: Knowledge Evolution**
Implement confidence-based knowledge evolution:
```python
pattern_confidence = {
    "initial": 0.5,
    "after_success": confidence * 1.1 (max 0.99),
    "after_failure": confidence * 0.9 (min 0.1),
    "promotion_threshold": 0.8,  # Becomes "stable" pattern
    "demotion_threshold": 0.3   # Marked for review
}
```

### 3.4 Project-Specific Agent Creation

#### **F-PSA-001: Project Analysis**
On first activation, analyze project comprehensively:
- Technology stack detection
- Architecture pattern identification
- Domain-specific requirements discovery
- Compliance needs assessment
- Performance requirements extraction

#### **F-PSA-002: Agent Swarm Generation**
Create specialized agents based on analysis:
```python
Example for Healthcare Project:
- healthcare-compliance-agent (Opus)
- patient-data-handler (Opus)
- appointment-scheduler (Sonnet)
- form-validator (Sonnet)
- code-formatter (Haiku)
- import-organizer (Haiku)
```

#### **F-PSA-003: Agent Health Monitoring**
Continuous monitoring of agent performance:
- Success rate tracking
- Execution time analysis
- Cost per task calculation
- Knowledge contribution metrics
- Automatic retraining triggers

### 3.5 Real-Time Collaboration

#### **F-RTC-001: Shared Context**
Agents working on related tasks share context:
```python
shared_context = {
    "task_id": "implement-auth-system",
    "discoveries": [],      # Real-time updates
    "blockers": [],        # Issues found
    "patterns": [],        # Successful approaches
    "participants": []     # Active agents
}
```

#### **F-RTC-002: Knowledge Broadcasting**
Implement pub/sub for knowledge sharing:
- Redis/WebSocket for real-time updates
- Topic-based subscriptions
- Priority levels for critical knowledge
- Conflict resolution for contradictory patterns
