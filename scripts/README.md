This directory contains all development, testing, and utility scripts organized by purpose.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `/development/`

- `create_*.py` - Project creation and initialization
- `update_*.py` - Update and modification scripts  
- `finalize_*.py` - Project finalization scripts
- `mark_*.py` - Phase marking and completion scripts

### `/testing/`

- `test_*.py` - Component and integration tests
- `quick_*.py` - Quick validation scripts
- Testing framework utilities

### `/debugging/`  
Debugging and investigation tools:
- `debug_*.py` - Debug analysis scripts

- `monitor_*.py` - Monitoring scripts

### `/fixes/`
Issue resolution and correction scripts:

- `execute_*.py` - Fix execution scripts
- Emergency repair utilities

### `/validation/`
Validation and verification tools:
- `*validation*.py` - Data validation scripts

## üöÄ Usage

All scripts maintain their original functionality and command-line interfaces. Simply reference them by their new organized paths:

```bash
# Before
python debug_deepconf.py

# After  
python scripts/debugging/debug_deepconf.py
```

## üìã Best Practices

- Scripts are categorized by primary function
- Original functionality preserved
- Use relative paths when calling between scripts
- Maintain backwards compatibility where possible

## üîß Production Safety

**Important**: These scripts are development tools and should not be used in production environments without proper testing and validation.
