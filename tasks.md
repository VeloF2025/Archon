## Agent Assignments
*Based on enhanced specification analysis*

**strategic-planner**: Tasks 1-4
**system-architect**: Tasks 5-8
**code-implementer**: Tasks 9-12
**test-coverage-validator**: Tasks 13-16
**code-quality-reviewer**: Tasks 17-20

## Quality Gates
- Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors
- >95% test coverage
- DGTS compliance
- Performance targets met
- Security validation passed

## Execution Notes
- Tasks 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 can be executed in parallel where possible
- Each phase depends on previous phases
- All quality gates must be satisfied before deployment
