  "output": "Phase 2 SCWT test results show OVERALL STATUS: FAILED. Key findings: Dynamic spawning worked perfectly (4/4 agents spawned successfully), orchestration system functional, but CRITICAL FAILURE in task execution - ALL 6 intelligent distribution tasks failed (0% success rate). Precision: 0.0% (target 85% - CRITICAL FAIL), scaling improvements 10% (target 15% - FAILED). Gate failures: Precision and Scaling Improvements. However, meta-orchestration systems (spawning, routing, scaling) are working correctly. Remediation needed: Fix task execution engine and precision measurement system.",
