# Archon Database Index Strategy Recommendations

## Future Scalability Framework

This document outlines a comprehensive index strategy designed to scale with Archon's growth while maintaining optimal performance.

## Growth-Based Index Strategy

### Phase 1: Current State (0-1K tasks, 0-10K documents)
**Status**: âœ… OPTIMIZED

**Current Strategy**:
- Missing foreign key index added
- 3 safest unused indexes removed  
- 4 performance composite indexes added
- All critical functionality preserved

**Performance Targets**: All met âœ…
- Task hierarchy queries: < 50ms
- Dashboard loads: < 200ms
- Write operations: No degradation

### Phase 2: Scale Growth (1K-10K tasks, 10K-100K documents)
**Trigger Metrics**:
- Task count > 1,000
- Daily active users > 50
- Document chunks > 10,000

**Recommended Indexes to Add Back**:
```sql
-- Task performance for high volume
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_archon_tasks_status_priority 
ON archon_tasks (status, task_order, created_at DESC) 
WHERE archived = FALSE;

-- User-specific task filtering
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_archon_tasks_assignee_status 
ON archon_tasks (assignee, status) 
INCLUDE (title, description);

-- Advanced metadata filtering
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_archon_sources_metadata_gin 
ON archon_sources USING GIN(metadata);
```

**Monitoring Command**:
```sql
-- Run monthly to check if Phase 2 is needed
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as task_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE archived = FALSE) as active_tasks,
    MAX(created_at) as newest_task
FROM archon_tasks;
```

### Phase 3: Enterprise Scale (10K+ tasks, 100K+ documents)  
**Trigger Metrics**:
- Task count > 10,000
- Concurrent users > 100
- Vector search queries > 1,000/day

**Advanced Indexing Strategy**:
```sql
-- Partitioning for task table
CREATE TABLE archon_tasks_y2024 PARTITION OF archon_tasks 
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

-- Advanced vector search optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_archon_code_examples_embedding_hnsw 
ON archon_code_examples 
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);

-- Multi-tenant performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_archon_projects_tenant_performance 
ON archon_projects (created_by, pinned, created_at DESC) 
INCLUDE (title, description);
```

## Vector Search Index Strategy

### Critical Protection Rules
1. **NEVER** drop `archon_code_examples_embedding_idx`
2. **NEVER** drop `archon_crawled_pages` embedding index
3. Monitor embedding index usage monthly

### Scaling Strategy
```sql
-- Current: IVFFlat indexes (good for moderate scale)
-- Future: HNSW indexes (better for high scale)

-- When vector searches > 1,000/day, consider HNSW:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_embedding_hnsw 
ON table_name USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

### Vector Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Monthly vector search performance check
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_searches,
    AVG(query_duration_ms) as avg_duration,
    MAX(query_duration_ms) as max_duration
FROM vector_search_logs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## Metadata Index Strategy

### Current Approach: Selective Indexing
- Dropped display name/title indexes (low usage)
- Preserved metadata GIN indexes for future features

### Future Metadata Strategy
```sql
-- Add back when advanced filtering is implemented
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_archon_sources_knowledge_type_metadata 
ON archon_sources ((metadata->>'knowledge_type'), created_at DESC);

-- For advanced search features
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_archon_code_examples_language_metadata 
ON archon_code_examples ((metadata->>'language'), summary text_pattern_ops);
```

## Write Performance Optimization Strategy

### Current Optimization Results
- Removed 3 unused indexes = 5-15% write improvement
- Maintained scalability indexes for future growth

### Ongoing Write Performance Strategy
```sql
-- Monitor write performance monthly
SELECT 
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins + n_tup_upd + n_tup_del as total_writes,
    ROUND(n_tup_upd::numeric / GREATEST(n_tup_ins, 1) * 100, 2) as update_ratio,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as table_size
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND relname LIKE 'archon_%'
ORDER BY total_writes DESC;
```

### Write Performance Rules
1. **Add indexes**: Only when query performance > write performance in importance
2. **Remove indexes**: When usage drops to 0 for 90+ days
3. **Composite indexes**: Prefer over multiple single-column indexes

## Monitoring & Maintenance Strategy

### Weekly Monitoring (Automated)
```sql
-- Index health check
SELECT * FROM monitor_index_health();

-- Usage patterns
SELECT * FROM archon_index_usage_monitoring 
WHERE usage_status IN ('ðŸ”´ UNUSED', 'ðŸŸ¡ LOW_USAGE');
```

### Monthly Deep Analysis
```sql
-- Comprehensive performance review
WITH index_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        schemaname, tablename, indexname,
        idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) as size
    FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
    WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
    AND tablename LIKE 'archon_%'
)
SELECT 
    tablename,
    COUNT(*) as total_indexes,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE idx_tup_read = 0) as unused_indexes,
    SUM(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) as total_index_size_bytes
FROM index_stats
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY total_index_size_bytes DESC;
```

### Quarterly Strategy Review
1. Analyze 3-month growth trends
2. Review index usage patterns
3. Plan next phase of optimization
4. Update index strategy based on feature development

## Performance Targets by Scale

### Small Scale (Current)
- Task queries: < 50ms
- Vector searches: < 200ms  
- Write operations: < 10ms
- Index overhead: < 50MB

### Medium Scale (Phase 2)
- Task queries: < 100ms
- Vector searches: < 300ms
- Write operations: < 25ms
- Index overhead: < 200MB

### Large Scale (Phase 3)
- Task queries: < 200ms
- Vector searches: < 500ms
- Write operations: < 50ms
- Index overhead: < 1GB

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Performance Degradation Response
1. **Immediate**: Run `monitor_index_health()` 
2. **Diagnosis**: Check `archon_index_usage_monitoring`
3. **Quick Fix**: Run specific index creation for bottleneck
4. **Emergency**: Execute `rollback_index_optimization()`

### Index Bloat Response
```sql
-- Check for index bloat
SELECT 
    tablename, indexname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) as current_size,
    CASE WHEN idx_tup_read = 0 THEN 'CANDIDATE_FOR_REMOVAL' ELSE 'IN_USE' END as usage_status
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename LIKE 'archon_%'
AND pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass) > 10 * 1024 * 1024 -- > 10MB
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass) DESC;
```

## Technology Evolution Strategy

### PostgreSQL Version Upgrades
- Monitor new index types (GiST, GIN, BRIN improvements)
- Evaluate HNSW for vector workloads
- Consider bloom filters for high-cardinality metadata

### Storage Optimization
- Consider partitioning for large tables (>1M rows)
- Evaluate compression for older data
- Monitor TOAST table growth for large text fields

### Query Pattern Evolution
- Track new query patterns from feature development
- Proactively add indexes for new access patterns
- Remove indexes for deprecated features

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- 95th percentile query response time
- Average write operation duration
- Index hit ratio (target: >99%)
- Storage efficiency (data:index ratio)

### Operational Metrics
- Index maintenance time
- Backup/restore duration
- Query optimization effectiveness
- Developer productivity (time to implement features)

This strategy ensures Archon's database performance scales gracefully while maintaining operational efficiency and development agility.
