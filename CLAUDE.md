# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Alpha Development Guidelines

**Local-only deployment** - each user runs their own instance.

### Core Principles

- **No backwards compatibility** - remove deprecated code immediately
- **Detailed errors over graceful failures** - we want to identify and fix issues fast
- **Break things to improve them** - alpha is for rapid iteration
- **75% Confidence Rule** - NEVER confirm something unless at least 75% confident. Say "I don't know" and figure it out together

### Error Handling

**Core Principle**: In alpha, we need to intelligently decide when to fail hard and fast to quickly address issues, and when to allow processes to complete in critical services despite failures. Read below carefully and make intelligent decisions on a case-by-case basis.

#### When to Fail Fast and Loud (Let it Crash!)

These errors should stop execution and bubble up immediately:

- **Service startup failures** - If credentials, database, or any service can't initialize, the system should crash with a clear error
- **Missing configuration** - Missing environment variables or invalid settings should stop the system
- **Database connection failures** - Don't hide connection issues, expose them
- **Authentication/authorization failures** - Security errors must be visible and halt the operation
- **Data corruption or validation errors** - Never silently accept bad data, Pydantic should raise
- **Critical dependencies unavailable** - If a required service is down, fail immediately
- **Invalid data that would corrupt state** - Never store zero embeddings, null foreign keys, or malformed JSON

#### When to Complete but Log Detailed Errors

These operations should continue but track and report failures clearly:

- **Batch processing** - When crawling websites or processing documents, complete what you can and report detailed failures for each item
- **Background tasks** - Embedding generation, async jobs should finish the queue but log failures
- **WebSocket events** - Don't crash on a single event failure, log it and continue serving other clients
- **Optional features** - If projects/tasks are disabled, log and skip rather than crash
- **External API calls** - Retry with exponential backoff, then fail with a clear message about what service failed and why

#### Critical Nuance: Never Accept Corrupted Data

When a process should continue despite failures, it must **skip the failed item entirely** rather than storing corrupted data:

**‚ùå WRONG - Silent Corruption:**

```python
try:
    embedding = create_embedding(text)
except Exception as e:
    embedding = [0.0] * 1536  # NEVER DO THIS - corrupts database
    store_document(doc, embedding)
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Skip Failed Items:**

```python
try:
    embedding = create_embedding(text)
    store_document(doc, embedding)  # Only store on success
except Exception as e:
    failed_items.append({'doc': doc, 'error': str(e)})
    logger.error(f"Skipping document {doc.id}: {e}")
    # Continue with next document, don't store anything
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Batch Processing with Failure Tracking:**

```python
def process_batch(items):
    results = {'succeeded': [], 'failed': []}

    for item in items:
        try:
            result = process_item(item)
            results['succeeded'].append(result)
        except Exception as e:
            results['failed'].append({
                'item': item,
                'error': str(e),
                'traceback': traceback.format_exc()
            })
            logger.error(f"Failed to process {item.id}: {e}")

    # Always return both successes and failures
    return results
```

#### Error Message Guidelines

- Include context about what was being attempted when the error occurred
- Preserve full stack traces with `exc_info=True` in Python logging
- Use specific exception types, not generic Exception catching
- Include relevant IDs, URLs, or data that helps debug the issue
- Never return None/null to indicate failure - raise an exception with details
- For batch operations, always report both success count and detailed failure list

### Code Quality

- Remove dead code immediately rather than maintaining it - no backward compatibility or legacy functions
- Prioritize functionality over production-ready patterns
- Focus on user experience and feature completeness
- When updating code, don't reference what is changing (avoid keywords like LEGACY, CHANGED, REMOVED), instead focus on comments that document just the functionality of the code

## üö´ 75% Confidence Rule - MANDATORY

### Never Confirm Unless Certain

**CRITICAL**: Claude Code/Archon must maintain intellectual honesty at all times.

#### Confidence Thresholds:
- **‚â•90% Confident**: Provide direct answer with full implementation
- **75-89% Confident**: Provide answer with explicit caveats about what needs verification
- **50-74% Confident**: Say "I'm not certain" and provide preliminary thoughts with clear uncertainties
- **<50% Confident**: Say "I don't know" and work together to figure it out

#### When to Say "I Don't Know":
- Code references that can't be validated
- Architecture decisions without clear context
- Bug fixes without seeing the actual error
- Performance optimizations without metrics
- Security implementations without requirements
- API usage without documentation

#### Response Templates by Confidence:

**High Confidence (‚â•90%)**:
```
Here's the solution: [direct implementation]
```

**Moderate Confidence (75-89%)**:
```
Based on my analysis (85% confidence):
[solution]
Note: Please verify [specific aspects] as I couldn't fully validate them.
```

**Low Confidence (50-74%)**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è I'm not certain about this (65% confidence), but here's what I found:
[preliminary thoughts]

I'm uncertain about:
- [specific uncertainty 1]
- [specific uncertainty 2]

To proceed confidently, we could:
- [suggestion 1]
- [suggestion 2]
```

**No Confidence (<50%)**:
```
I don't know the answer to this.

To help you properly, I need:
- [missing information 1]
- [missing information 2]

Let's figure this out together. Could you:
- [actionable request 1]
- [actionable request 2]
```

#### Implementation in Code:
```python
if confidence < 0.75:
    return "I don't know. Let's figure this out together."
```

#### Benefits of Honesty:
- **Builds Trust**: Users know they can rely on your answers
- **Saves Time**: No debugging hallucinated code
- **Better Collaboration**: Working together leads to better solutions
- **Learning Opportunity**: Both AI and human learn from the process

## Architecture Overview

Archon V2 Alpha is a microservices-based knowledge management system with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration:

- **Frontend (port 3737)**: React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **Main Server (port 8181)**: FastAPI + Socket.IO for real-time updates
- **MCP Server (port 8051)**: Lightweight HTTP-based MCP protocol server
- **Agents Service (port 8052)**: PydanticAI agents for AI/ML operations
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector for embeddings)

3. Test tool execution via UI MCP page
4. Verify Supabase connection and credentials

## Code Quality Standards

We enforce code quality through automated linting and type checking:

- **Python 3.12** with 120 character line length
- **Ruff** for linting - checks for errors, warnings, unused imports, and code style
- **Mypy** for type checking - ensures type safety across the codebase
- **Auto-formatting** on save in IDEs to maintain consistent style
- Run `uv run ruff check` and `uv run mypy src/` locally before committing

## MCP Tools Available

When connected to Cursor/Windsurf:

- `archon:perform_rag_query` - Search knowledge base
- `archon:search_code_examples` - Find code snippets
- `archon:manage_project` - Project operations
- `archon:manage_task` - Task management
- `archon:get_available_sources` - List knowledge sources

## Important Notes

- Projects feature is optional - toggle in Settings UI
- All services communicate via HTTP, not gRPC
- Socket.IO handles all real-time updates
- Frontend uses Vite proxy for API calls in development
- Python backend uses `uv` for dependency management
- Docker Compose handles service orchestration
