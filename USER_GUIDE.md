## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

### Agent Intelligence Tiers

The Agency Swarm system uses three intelligence tiers:

1. **Sonnet Tier** (Default)
   - Balanced performance and cost
   - Ideal for most tasks
   - Smart escalation to higher tiers

2. **Opus Tier** (Premium)
   - Highest capability and reasoning
   - Complex problem solving
   - Strategic planning tasks

3. **Haiku Tier** (Fast)
   - Quick response times
   - Simple tasks and queries
   - High-volume processing

### Agent States

Agents operate in 5 distinct states:

- **IDLE**: Ready to accept tasks
- **ACTIVE**: Currently processing tasks
- **THINKING**: Analyzing and planning
- **HIBERNATING**: Conserving resources (30+ minutes idle)
- **ERROR**: Requires intervention

### Agent Types

Available agent specializations:

- **CODE_IMPLEMENTER**: Software development and coding
- **STRATEGIC_PLANNER**: Project planning and task breakdown
- **KNOWLEDGE_MANAGER**: Information processing and organization
- **QUALITY_ASSURANCE**: Testing and validation
- **SECURITY_ANALYST**: Security assessment and compliance
- **PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZER**: Performance tuning and optimization

## ðŸ’¬ Agent Communication

### Real-time Messaging

The Agency Swarm enables real-time communication between agents:

```typescript
// Example of agent communication
const message = {
  from: "code-implementer",
  to: "quality-assurance",
  content: "Code review completed for feature X",
  priority: "normal",
  metadata: {
    taskId: "task-123",
    confidence: 0.95
  }
};
```

### Communication Channels

1. **Direct Messaging**: Point-to-point communication between agents
2. **Broadcast Messages**: One-to-many announcements
3. **Topic-based**: Organized by project or task categories
4. **Emergency Channels**: High-priority issue escalation

### Collaboration Features

- **Shared Context**: Agents can access shared knowledge and context
- **Task Handoffs**: Seamless transfer of tasks between agents
- **Consensus Building**: Multiple agents can collaborate on decisions
- **Expertise Matching**: Automatic routing to most qualified agent

## ðŸ“‹ Task Management

### Creating Tasks

1. **Manual Task Creation**
   ```bash
   Navigate to Tasks tab
   Click "Create New Task"
   Fill in task details and assign to agents
   ```

2. **Agent-Initiated Tasks**
   ```bash
   Agents can create sub-tasks when needed
   Automatic task breakdown for complex requirements
   Dynamic task assignment based on availability
   ```

### Task Workflow
