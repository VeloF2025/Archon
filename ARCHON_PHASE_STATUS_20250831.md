## Task Priorities

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Document Phase 7 Success** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Created comprehensive completion summary
   - Documented exceptional performance metrics
   - Updated project status records

2. **Fix Phase 2 Meta-Agent System** (CRITICAL)
   - Debug task execution timeouts
   - Fix intelligent distribution
   - Repair orchestration pipeline

3. **Leverage Phase 7 Success** (NEW)
   - Apply DeepConf patterns to other phases
   - Integrate confidence scoring across system
   - Use multi-model consensus for Phase 2 fixes

### Strategic Opportunities
1. **Phase 7 Pattern Replication**
   - Apply successful TDD methodology to Phase 2
   - Use confidence-based validation in other components
   - Implement real-time monitoring across all phases

2. **Cost Optimization Rollout**
   - Apply Phase 7's 65% cost savings model system-wide
   - Implement token efficiency improvements
   - Scale performance optimizations

## Next Recommended Action
**Leverage Phase 7 Success**: Use the exceptional DeepConf integration patterns and methodologies to fix Phase 2. The advanced confidence scoring and multi-model consensus could address Phase 2's orchestration failures.
