Test results: precision 88% (target 85% - PASSED), task efficiency 99.8% (target 15% - PASSED), communication efficiency 15% (target 10% - PASSED), UI usability 7.3% (target 5% - PASSED), hallucination rate 15%. However, all 3 test tasks failed (0 completed, 3 failed): create_auth_endpoint, create_login_form, generate_tests. Knowledge reuse 12% but no target specified. Since overall gates PASSED but individual tasks failed, what remediation is needed?",
