# Architecture Decision Record: Archon Enhancement 2025

**ADR Number**: 015  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Technical Leadership  
**Technical Story**: Implementation of next-generation AI development platform features

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Archon has proven successful as an AI coding assistant, but to remain competitive and provide maximum value, we need to evolve into a comprehensive, self-improving AI development platform. Key challenges include:

1. Knowledge is siloed within individual projects
2. Agents don't learn from their experiences
3. System is reactive rather than predictive
4. Limited integration with development workflows
5. No autonomous problem resolution

We need to make architectural decisions that will enable self-learning, predictive assistance, and autonomous operations while maintaining system stability and performance.

---

## Decision Drivers

- **Scalability**: Must handle 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Learning Capability**: Continuous improvement from interactions
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing tools
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture for long-term evolution
- **Cost**: Reasonable infrastructure and operational costs

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Monolithic AI Enhancement
- Single service handling all new features
- Shared database and memory
- Simpler deployment

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture (Recommended)
- Separate services for each major capability
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Technology diversity allowed

### Option 3: Serverless Functions
- Function-as-a-Service for each feature
- Pay-per-use model
- Vendor lock-in concerns

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: **Option 2 - Microservices Architecture**

### Rationale
- Allows independent scaling of resource-intensive services (ML training, graph operations)
- Enables technology diversity (Neo4j for graphs, TensorFlow for ML)
- Facilitates incremental deployment and rollback
- Supports team autonomy and parallel development
- Aligns with current Archon architecture

---

## Detailed Architectural Decisions

### 1. Pattern Recognition Architecture

**Decision**: Use event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka for pattern detection

```python
# Pattern Recognition Service Architecture
class PatternRecognitionService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.kafka_consumer = KafkaConsumer('code-events')
        self.pattern_detector = MLPatternDetector()
        self.pattern_store = PostgreSQL()
        self.vector_store = Pinecone()
    
    async def process_event(self, event):
        patterns = await self.pattern_detector.detect(event)
        await self.store_patterns(patterns)
        await self.broadcast_patterns(patterns)
```

**Rationale**:
- Event-driven allows real-time pattern detection
- Kafka provides reliable event streaming at scale
- Separation of detection and storage allows optimization

### 2. Knowledge Graph Technology

**Decision**: Neo4j for graph database with GraphQL API

```cypher
// Knowledge Graph Schema
CREATE (concept:Concept {
    id: UUID,
    name: STRING,
    category: STRING,
    embedding: VECTOR,
    created_at: TIMESTAMP,
    relevance_score: FLOAT
})

CREATE (concept1)-[:RELATES_TO {
    strength: FLOAT,
    context: STRING,
    discovered_at: TIMESTAMP
}]->(concept2)
```

**Rationale**:
- Neo4j is industry-leading graph database
- GraphQL provides flexible querying
- Native graph operations for relationship traversal
- Built-in graph algorithms for analysis

### 3. ML Model Management

**Decision**: MLflow for model lifecycle management

```yaml
ml_architecture:
  training:
    framework: TensorFlow/PyTorch
    orchestration: Kubeflow
    tracking: MLflow
  
  serving:
    platform: TensorFlow Serving / TorchServe
    api: gRPC + REST
    caching: Redis
  
  monitoring:
    metrics: Prometheus
    drift_detection: Custom service
    retraining: Automated pipeline
```

**Rationale**:
- MLflow provides comprehensive model tracking
- Supports multiple ML frameworks
- Versioning and rollback capabilities
- Integration with existing tools

### 4. Self-Healing Architecture

**Decision**: Kubernetes Operators for autonomous operations

```yaml
apiVersion: archon.io/v1
kind: SelfHealingPolicy
metadata:
  name: auto-recovery
spec:
  triggers:
    - errorRate: ">5%"
    - responseTime: ">2s"
    - memoryUsage: ">90%"
  
  actions:
    - restart: true
    - scale: true
    - rollback: true
  
  notifications:
    - slack: true
    - email: true
```

**Rationale**:
- Kubernetes native approach
- Declarative configuration
- Battle-tested in production
- Extensive ecosystem support

### 5. Data Architecture

**Decision**: Polyglot persistence with purpose-built databases

```yaml
data_stores:
  relational:
    purpose: Transactional data, user management
    technology: PostgreSQL 15+
    
  graph:
    purpose: Knowledge relationships
    technology: Neo4j 5.0+
    
  vector:
    purpose: Embeddings, similarity search
    technology: Pinecone / pgvector
    
  time_series:
    purpose: Metrics, monitoring
    technology: TimescaleDB
    
  cache:
    purpose: Session data, hot cache
    technology: Redis Cluster
    
  object:
    purpose: Models, large files
    technology: S3 / MinIO
```

**Rationale**:
- Each database optimized for specific use case
- Avoid one-size-fits-all limitations
- Best performance for each data type
- Mature technologies with community support

### 6. Integration Strategy

**Decision**: API Gateway pattern with service mesh

```yaml
integration_architecture:
  external:
    api_gateway: Kong / Traefik
    authentication: OAuth2 / JWT
    rate_limiting: Per-client quotas
    
  internal:
    service_mesh: Istio (optional)
    communication: gRPC + REST
    discovery: Kubernetes DNS
    
  messaging:
    events: Apache Kafka
    pubsub: Redis
    queues: RabbitMQ (for tasks)
```

**Rationale**:
- Single entry point for external clients
- Service mesh provides observability
- Multiple communication patterns supported
- Gradual adoption possible
